# Dedupe prompt (`prompts.dedupe`)

**Model: fable.** Merge errors in this stage silently drop findings — a finding merged
away here never reaches a judge, and nothing downstream can recover it. Because a mistake
is unrecoverable rather than merely miscalibrated, this stage gets frontier judgment
instead of the sonnet tier used elsewhere in the pipeline.

The string below is `args.prompts.dedupe` verbatim: a plain string dispatchable through
the Task tool with no engine-specific syntax. It contains exactly one engine-substituted
token, `{{FINDINGS_JSON}}` (replaced with the pooled raw findings array before dispatch),
and one orchestrator-substituted literal, `[REMAINDER_CAP]` (replaced with the configured
cap, default 50, before the prompt is assembled).

```
You receive the pooled findings from several adversarial reviewers. Overlapping reviewers
surface the same issue repeatedly, and some findings matter far more than others. Your job:
merge duplicates, suggest a severity for each distinct finding, and select which ones the
rest of the pipeline verifies. You do NOT judge whether a finding is true — that is the
judges' job. Never invent a finding, and never drop a distinct issue.

## Findings (pooled, raw)
{{FINDINGS_JSON}}

## Step 1 — Merge
Combine near-duplicates: findings with the **same location AND the same root claim** are
one finding. Keep the strongest/most-specific evidence and the union of locations across
the merged set. Different root claims at the same location are NOT duplicates — keep them
separate. Preserve each finding's `kind`, `external` flag, and `spike` through the merge.

## Step 2 — Suggest severity
For each merged finding, suggest one severity:
- **Blocking:** if unaddressed, the change/design is likely to be wrong, lose data, or
  fail its core purpose — must fix before proceeding.
- **Should-fix:** significant risk or rework; address before or soon after merge.
- **Nit:** real but low-impact.
- **FYI:** context/observation, no action required.

This is a suggestion only. It routes how much verification depth a finding gets and
informs the reporter — it does not bind either: judges rate severity independently of
your suggestion, and the reporter decides the finding's final severity.

## Step 3 — Select
Keep EVERY finding suggested Blocking or Should-fix — these are never capped. Order the
remaining Nit/FYI findings by importance, correctness and risk first, and keep only the
top `[REMAINDER_CAP]` of them. Count how many Nit/FYI findings were dropped past that cap
and report it as `beyondCapCount`.

## Output contract (exact — return one JSON object matching this shape, no prose outside it)
- **findings:** the kept findings (every Blocking/Should-fix, plus the top `[REMAINDER_CAP]`
  Nit/FYI). Each finding:
  - `claim` (string, required)
  - `location` (string, required)
  - `category` (string, required)
  - `external` (boolean, required)
  - `evidence` (string, required)
  - `suggestedSeverity`: `"Blocking"` | `"Should-fix"` | `"Nit"` | `"FYI"` (required)
  - `kind`: `"GAP"` | `"UNVERIFIED-ASSUMPTION"` | `"ISSUE"` (carry through if present)
  - `spike`: (carry through if present)
- **beyondCapCount:** integer — the number of Nit/FYI findings dropped past the cap.

Never use `blocker`, `major`, `minor`, `BLOCK`, `REVISE`, or `PASS` — those vocabularies
are retired. Use only `Blocking | Should-fix | Nit | FYI`.
